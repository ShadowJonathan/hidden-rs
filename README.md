# `hidden`

A library to handle something akin to [hidden-variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory) objects, 
where an internal state is randomized/altered after every "interaction".

*Note: This library is in alpha, likely to change, and may not follow the 
[Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html) as well as you'd expect, although I try to
match it. Contributions are welcome.*
